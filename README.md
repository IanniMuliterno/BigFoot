Usando dados de "avistamento do Pé grande" para praticar estatística espacial.

Using BigFoot Sighting Data to practice Spatial Statistics


_Data set is public, you can find it at <https://www.bfro.net/>, or if ya feeling lazy, just get the version above, remember it's not up to date, tough_

_ps: All the excitement of working with a fun data set made me ignore the fact that I shouldn't be using a discrete response variable if I need to suppose it's normal at some point, don't do that kids._
